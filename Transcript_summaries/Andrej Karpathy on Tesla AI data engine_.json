    "text": " Yeah, the data engine is what I call the almost biological feeling like process by which you perfect the training sets for these neural networks. So because most of the programming now is in the level of these data sets and make sure they're large, diverse, and clean, basically, you have a data set that you think is good. You train your neural net, you deploy it, and then you observe how well it's performing. And you're trying to always increase the quality of your data set. So you're trying to catch scenarios, basically, they are basically rare. And it is in these scenarios that your own network typically struggle in because they weren't told what to do in those rare cases in the data set. But now you can close the loop because if you can now collect all those at scale, you can then feed them back into the reconstruction process I described and reconstruct the truth in those cases and add it to the data set. And so the whole thing ends up being like a staircase of improvement of perfecting your training set. And you have to go through deployments so that you can mine the parts that are not yet represented well in the data set. So your data set is basically imperfect. It needs to be diverse. It has pockets. There are missing. And you need to pad out the pockets. You can sort of think of it that way."

    "summary": "The conversation is discussing the concept of the data engine and the role of humans in optimizing it. The data engine refers to the process of perfecting training sets for neural networks by continuously improving the quality and diversity of the data. The goal is to identify rare scenarios where neural networks struggle and then collect data on those scenarios to add to the training set. This process of improvement is compared to a staircase.\n\nHumans play a crucial role in the data engine by executing the process with extreme precision and understanding the underlying concepts. The focus is on good execution rather than research or ideation. The prioritization of tasks and the vision come from the goals of the product and feedback from users. The Q18 feedback helps identify areas where the system is struggling and needs improvement.\n\nIndividual experience and interaction with the system provide valuable insights that cannot be obtained through aggregate statistical analysis alone. Numbers and graphs may hide important details, while personal interaction allows for intuition and a better understanding of the system. Elon Musk is mentioned as someone who values personal experience and drives the system himself to assess its performance."
