    "summary": "In this conversation, the speakers discuss the issue of racial profiling and the widespread institutional racism in policing. They mention that African Americans often feel under-protected by the police and that there is a long history of African Americans facing racial discrimination in law enforcement. The speakers also highlight the need for accountability and transparency in the police force, arguing that police officers should be held responsible for their actions. They also discuss the hypocrisy of some conservatives who advocate for limited government and transparency but support police unions and resist transparency in policing. The conversation touches on the psychological impact of contempt and the negative consequences it can have on police-citizen interactions. The speakers debate the use of racial profiling and argue that it goes against the principles of equality and fairness. They suggest that everyone should be treated the same by law enforcement, and that racial profiling is not an effective or ethical strategy. Overall, the conversation emphasizes the need for good policing, respect for both civilians and police officers, and a system that upholds equality and fairness."
