And I'll throw out some random like, hey, can you change instead of having log and X as LL ops, change it to log to an X, too? It's pretty small change, you can just use like change a base formula. That's the kind of task that I can see in AI being able to do in a few years. Like in a few years I could see myself describing that and then within 30 seconds of pull request is up that does it. And it passes my CI and I merge it, right? So I really started thinking about like, well, what is the future of,"

They also discuss the future of jobs and the potential impact of AI in replacing human workers. The speaker contemplates employing AI at their company and using GitHub as a way to evaluate potential hires. They also discuss the importance of AI aligning with human intentions and the need for individual ownership of AI through devices like \"tiny boxes\". The speaker expresses their belief in anarchy in the virtual world but acknowledges the need for regulation in the physical world. They emphasize the importance of robust and autonomous machines and express a hope for AI to create a vibrant and diverse civilization. The conversation concludes with a hopeful message."
