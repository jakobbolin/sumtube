That's the one where going into the final race, Verstappen and Hamilton were tied, even winner take all for the championship that year. And I was very controversial ending. It was the safety cars. So basically, Lewis is leading Max's in second, and then with like a few laps to go, who spun out? I think Nickas Latifi hit the wall, which needed a safety car. And in the process, there's a rule that says every lap car should be able to un-lap itself for the restart, but they only let the cars between Hamilton and Verstappen un-lap themselves.
