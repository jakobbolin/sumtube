I thought that was a really good book that helped me understand altruism as an example and where it comes from and just realizing that, you know, the selection is on a level of genes was a huge insight for me at the time and it sort of like cleared up a lot of things for me.

Speaker 00 recommends \"The Vital Question\" and anything by Nick Lane, such as \"Life Ascending\" and \"The Selfish Gene\". They also discuss the concept of ideas being the organisms, or \"software\", that drive human civilization, with Speaker 01 agreeing and suggesting that the software is what makes individuals survive. They also touch on the idea of textbooks being more helpful for understanding specific subjects in depth, while still acknowledging the limitations of textbooks, especially in rapidly evolving fields like deep learning and synthetic biology. They mention the importance of working hands-on with cells and conducting experiments for a deeper understanding. Speaker 01 wonders about the future of AI textbooks and mentions the usefulness of papers and code, but also notes that some scientists unnecessarily use complex terms. Overall, the conversation explores the impact of books and textbooks, the role of ideas as organisms, the limitations of textbooks and the importance of working with cells in understanding biology, and the usefulness of papers for detailed information in specific fields."
