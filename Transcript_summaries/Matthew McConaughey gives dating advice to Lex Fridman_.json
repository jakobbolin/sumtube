They talk about how love is a mystical success and doesn't always make sense. Before meeting Camila, the speaker was searching for love and would constantly look for potential partners. They learned that being outside of oneself and intrusive can make a person less attractive to others. The speaker then shares a dream they had about being a bachelor. They realized that they were okay with not finding love, and that groundedness allowed them to be themselves when they met Camila. They emphasize the importance of shared values and perspectives on raising children in their relationship. The speaker and Camila support and promote each other, get excited for each other's success, and choose to be happy for each other's achievements. They talk about overcoming jealousy in a relationship and not giving it any time. The speaker concludes that they have experienced jealousy but haven't seen any payback from it."
